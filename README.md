# Professional PHP5

Every once in a while I like to come back to basics. To see how it all came to be. It's educational and sometimes
nostalgic to look back and see the practices we've used five-ten years ago.

This book, originally published in 2005 introduced object-oriented approach to the wide public of php developers. For
that time it revolutionized the way I thought about web development.

This repository is the tribute to something that once made me a better programmer.
